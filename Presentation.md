##What is Lift?

* A web framework using Scala and running on the Java Virtual Machine.

##Why is it Interesting?

* Newer programming languages that support functional programming features get a lot of buzz.
* I want to get a sense of what it would be like to use one for an everyday software development task like building a web application.
* Dynamically typed languages like have some disadvantages when used on large-scale projects.
    * Performance can be worse.
    * Development environments for dynamic languages typically lack features like automatic refactoring, accurate code completion and jumping to variable and method definitions.
        * These features are useful when working with large codebases.
* Scala is statically-typed, but includes many advanced languages like support for functional programming.
* It also runs on the Java Virtual Machine, an environment already supported in many enterprises.
* Could potentially be a replacement for Java web development.

##Installing Lift

* Highly automated installation process on all operating systems.
* Need to have Java 1.7 or later installed.
